rcG = position of camera with respect to ECEF origin expressed in ECEF frame
rcGR = position of camera with respect to reference antenna expressed in ECEF frame
rcGI = position of camera with respect to inertial origin expressed in ECEF frame

RrcGR = covariance(rcGR)


rcI = position of camera with respect to inertial origin expressed in inertial (ENU) frame


rcB = position of camera with respect to body origin expressed in body frame

ecI = 3-2-1 euler rotation of camera with respect to inertial (ENU) frame
RecI = covariance(ecI)

rbi = position of balloon on image plane
